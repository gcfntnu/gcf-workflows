Small RNA sequencing pipeline


### Introduction
small-rna: Small RNA sequencing pipeline

The pipeline is built using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io).


### Documentation
The UNITAS workflow writes raw counts as float32 in `quant/unitas/adata.h5ad`, with samples in `obs` and miRNA features in `var`. Sample and feature metadata are aligned to the count table; absent feature annotations remain missing and emit a warning rather than dropping count rows. H5AD metadata column names escape `%` as `%25` and `/` as `%2F` (for example `260/280` becomes `260%2F280`). Original names are retained in `uns['metadata_column_names']['obs' or 'var']`, keyed by the encoded name. Cell values and sample/feature identifiers are unchanged.

`unitas_mirna_vsn` computes DESeq2-transformed counts in the existing `tximport` image and writes `mirna_vsd.tsv`. The AnnData job loads this table into `layers['vsd']` in the Scanpy image, which does not need R or rpy2. Both axes must exactly match the count table. The transformation uses features by samples, `round(counts + 1)` and `fitType="mean"`; it chooses rlog for at most 50 samples and variance-stabilizing transformation for larger cohorts. `uns['varians_transform']` records the method. This corrects the old in-process conversion's reversed feature/sample axes without changing raw counts.

The standalone creator still supports `--add-vsn` with R, DESeq2 and rpy2 installed. Use `--add-vsn --vsn-input transformed.tsv` for a precomputed table produced by `mirna_vsn.R` with the same settings. The existing versioned Scanpy and tximport image selections are retained; the API regression job tests AnnData 0.13.3.post0 with NumPy 2.5.2 and pandas 3.0.5 rather than downgrading the shared image.

Run the Python regressions with:

```bash
python -m pytest -q smallrna/.tests/test_create_anndata.py
```

These tests cover CLI/H5AD roundtrips, count dtype, metadata ordering and VSN layer assembly. The standalone R bridge is mocked in these tests; real DESeq2 and complete human/mouse workflows require container integration.
