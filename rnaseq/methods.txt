RNA-seq
=======
FASTQ files quality controlled with fastqc (v0.11.9) then filtered and
trimmed by fastp (v0.20.0). Trimmed sequences were aligned to the
genome reference using STAR (v2.7.3) and quality metrics were
extracted with picard CollectRNASeqMetrics (v2.21.5). Transcript
counts were generated using quasi alignment (Salmon v1.3.0) to the
GRCh38 transcriptome reference sequences. Transcript counts were
imported into the R statistical software and aggregated to gene counts
using the tximport (v1.14.0) bioconductor package for downstream
statistical analysis. Gene counts were normalized and analyzed for
differential expression using the DESeq2 bioconductor package. DESeq2
is specialized software for analysis of RNA-seq data and builds a
generalized linear model under the assumption of negative binomial
distributed values and uses the Wald statistic for significance
testing.
