FASTQ files were filtered and trimmed (fastp v0.20.0) and transcript
counts were generated using quasi alignment (Salmon v1.3.0) to the
transcriptome reference sequence (Ensembl, GRCh38 release
92). Transcript sequences were imported into the R statistical
software and aggregated to gene counts using the tximport (v1.14.0)
bioconductor package.Gene counts were normalized and analyzed for
differential expression using the DESeq2 bioconductor package. DESeq2
is a specialized software for analysis of rna-seq data and builds a
generalized linear model under the assumption of negative binomial
distributed values and uses the Wald statistic for significance
testing.
